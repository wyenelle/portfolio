        Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes
        and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web
        development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of
        building software for an advertising agency, a start-up, a student-led
        design studio, and a huge corporation. My main focus these days is
        building products and leading projects for our clients at Upstatement.
        In my free time I've also released an online video course that covers
        everything you need to know to build a web app with the Spotify API.
        When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing, hanging out
        with my wife and two cats, or running around Hyrule searching for Korok
